In your command console cd to the folder you want to start your project in.

-> django-admin startproject your_project_name
You should now have a folder with one additional folder named like your project and some files including "manage.py".

Cd into the project folder, where the manage.py file is located.
-> python manage.py startapp my_app_name
This creates a new "app" inside the existing structure. Apps are how you structure different segments of your page. If you want for example a blog for your mainpage and include a shop or a forum etc. you would create a blog-app and a shop-app this way and have each handle its respective logic.

START THE SERVER using "python manage.py runserver" in your console
# add localhost address

Now the work inside our actual page-infrastructure starts:
1. create a view function for "home" in our .../app/views.py by importing and returning a simple HttpResponse.

2. create urls.py in your app-folder, import your views, copy and manipulate urlpatterns from projectlevel urls.py.
This will handle connections to our blog-page and its subpages.

3. go to projectlevel urls.py, import include in addition to path, add reference to blog.urls using include.

4. create view function for "about" in our ...app/views.py.

5. create correponding url in blog.urls.py.

6. empty the path to blog in main.urls.
This will make blog the default page/home.
